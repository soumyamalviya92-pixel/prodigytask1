# Task-01: Text Generation with GPT-2

 📌 Project Overview
 
The objective of this task is to **train and fine-tune a GPT-2 transformer model** to generate **coherent and contextually relevant text** based on a given prompt.

The project demonstrates the complete workflow of:
- Preparing a custom text dataset
- Fine-tuning GPT-2 using HuggingFace Transformers
- Generating human-like text outputs

 🧠 About GPT-2

  GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2) is a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI.  
  It is capable of understanding context and generating meaningful text by learning patterns from data.



 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
 - **Python**
 - **Google Colab**
 - **HuggingFace Transformers**
 - **PyTorch**
 - **GPT-2 Language Model**
 - **GitHub**



## 📂 Project Structure

⚙️ Implementation Steps

1. Set up Google Colab with GPU support  
2. Installed required libraries (`transformers`, `torch`, `datasets`)  
3. Created a custom text dataset  
4. Loaded GPT-2 tokenizer and pre-trained model  
5. Tokenized the dataset  
6. Fine-tuned GPT-2 on the custom dataset  
7. Generated text using a user-defined prompt  
8. Saved the trained model and tokenizer  


 📊 Outputs & Results
- The fine-tuned GPT-2 model successfully generates **contextually relevant and human-like text**
- The generated outputs demonstrate that the model has learned the style and structure of the training data


📌 **Important Note:**  
Due to GitHub notebook rendering limitations,  
👉 **ALL TRAINING OUTPUTS AND GENERATED TEXT RESULTS ARE SHOWN IN THE GOOGLE COLAB NOTEBOOK:**

 Please open the notebook in **Google Colab** to view:
 - Training logs
 - Loss values
 - Generated text outputs



## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Open `prodigytask1.ipynb` in **Google Colab**
2. Enable GPU:  
   `Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU`
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. Observe training and text generation outputs



✅ Task Status

✔ Task-01 completed successfully  
✔ GPT-2 fine-tuning implemented  
✔ Text generation outputs verified
